# AVRDude config

You need to add the config section in avrdude.conf to your the avrdude.conf you are using, on OSX it would be

    /Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Resources/Java/hardware/tools/avr/etc/

## TODO

  * Check the paths on Linux and Windows
  * Make a patcher script that can add this section automagically (on Linux and OSX, someone else will have to figure out how to do that in Windows)
